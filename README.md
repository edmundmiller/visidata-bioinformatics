# Visidata Plugins for Bioinformatics Formats

Formats:

- GFF2/3
- BED

## Installation and Usage

1. Save the code as `gff.py` in your VisiData plugins directory (`~/.visidata/plugins/`)
2. Launch VisiData with any GFF file: `vd your_file.gff`

Now your GFF attributes are neatly spread across columns, making it easy to sort, filter, and analyze your genomic features.
